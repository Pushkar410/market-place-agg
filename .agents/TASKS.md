# Active Tasks

## Project pivot (Mini Project Phase 1)
- Repo now delivers the *Agentic AI-Based Trust-Aware Marketplace Aggregator* (backend `aggregator/` package + frontend `src/aggregator/`, route `/`; old home at `/marketplace`). See README.md, docs/LOCAL_SETUP.md, docs/AWS_DEPLOYMENT.md. Added since: planner + clarification, grounded LLM explanation, community-shared listings (`/share`), search-history/trust-score persistence (V21).
- Next: run backend tests on a machine with Maven access; execute AWS steps; complete Flyway migrations before using the `prod` profile.

## Current Work
- Status: Local Environment Up & Running
- Active Task: Local Environment Setup and Execution Complete (Backend on :8080, Frontend on :5173, Docker: Postgres/Redis/Kafka)
- Next Step: Ready for user testing / exploration.

## Backlog / Completed
- [x] Standardized `favoriteCount` metrics end-to-end:
  - Linked `ListingSocialProofService` to `FavoriteStatsService` ensuring unified counts and cache consistency.
  - Added root getter `getFavoriteCount()` in [ListingDto.java](file:///Users/serhat/IdeaProjects/secondHand/src/main/java/com/serhat/secondhand/listing/domain/dto/response/listing/ListingDto.java) delegating to `favoriteStats` and `socialProof`.
  - Created standardized `getListingFavoriteCount(listing)` helper in frontend [favorites.js](file:///Users/serhat/IdeaProjects/secondHand/secondhand-frontend/src/favorites/favorites.js).
  - Cleaned up confusing multi-level fallback chains across `ListingCard`, `ListingDetailPage`, `FavoritesPage`, and `ShoppingCartPage`.
  - Validated tests: `ListingSocialProofServiceTest` and `CartSocialMetricServiceTest` passing (6/6).
- [x] Created `CartSocialMetricService` with O(1) Redis operations (`recordListingAddedToCart`, `recordListingRemovedFromCart`, `getInCartCount`).
- [x] Created unified `ListingSocialProofDto` and `ListingSocialProofService`.
- [x] Cleaned up legacy DB query `CartRepository.countActiveReservationsByListing` and deprecated direct count queries.
- [x] Added `GET /api/v1/listings/{id}/social-proof` endpoint to `ListingViewController`.
- [x] Synchronized `CartReservationScheduler` to drop expired reservations from Redis set.
- [x] Updated frontend `useActiveReservationCount` hook and `apiEndpoints.js` to use unified `/social-proof` endpoint.
- [x] Added automated unit tests `CartSocialMetricServiceTest` and `ListingSocialProofServiceTest` (all passed).
- [x] Fixed Kafka Deserialization Exception in `inventory-sync-consumers` with `ErrorHandlingDeserializer`.
- [x] Implemented Checkout Page Stock Reservation via `POST /api/checkout/initiate` (Redis TTL 15 min).
- [x] Fixed broken/duplicate HTML tags across Thymeleaf templates (`offers/accepted.html`, `offers/rejected.html`, `offers/completed.html`, `offers/expired.html`, `orders/sale-notification.html`, `payments/receipt.html`).
- [x] Migrated all hardcoded email text and subjects from YAML into Spring `MessageSource` bundles (`messages.properties` & `messages_en.properties`).
- [x] Cleaned `application-email.yml` to contain only infrastructure and SMTP settings.
- [x] Modernized email templates (`orders/*`, `notifications/*`, `offers/*`, `payments/*`, `system/*`) with SecondHand design system.
- [x] Upgraded `emailExecutor` async pool configuration (5 core, 20 max, 500 queue, CallerRunsPolicy).
- [x] Synchronized [email/README.md](file:///Users/serhat/IdeaProjects/secondHand/src/main/java/com/serhat/secondhand/email/README.md) documenting all 23 email event workflows and retry schedulers.

## Next Work
- AI streaming endpoint test
- Postman import and manual testing
- Close role-based controller endpoints missing `@PreAuthorize`
- CI/CD pipeline setup

## Open Risks
- Verify missing `@PreAuthorize` endpoints
- `usePlan` hook fetches on every component mount, check `staleTime`
- Test Offer card mobile view
- Payment repository `findByFilters` query is complex and carries performance risk
- Global cache invalidation in `PaymentProcessor` may negatively impact performance
